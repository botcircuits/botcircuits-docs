# Building Your First AI Assistant

Welcome to the **BotCircuits Quickstart Guide**! In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create your first AI-powered assistant from scratch. Whether you're building a text-based or voice-based agent, this guide will help you set everything up quickly and efficiently.

> **Note:** Voice-based AI agents are available only on the **Growth Plan** or higher. If you're building a voice assistant, make sure you're on the appropriate plan to access this feature.

---

## Step 1: Sign In and Create a New Assistant

After signing in to the BotCircuits platform, you'll land on the [Home Page](https://platform.botcircuits.com/agents). To begin, click the **New Assistant** button.

---

## Step 2: Name and Describe Your Assistant

You'll be prompted to provide a **Name** and **Description** for your new assistant. This is for your internal use only, helping you identify the assistant within your dashboard.

- **Name**: Choose a name that reflects the assistant's purpose (e.g., "SupportBot" or "ReservationAssistant").
- **Description**: Add a brief description to remind yourself of the assistant's function.

This information is not used by the AI and is purely for organizational purposes.

---

## Step 3: Design the User Journey

Once you've created your assistant, you'll be redirected to the **Journey Editor**. The journey represents the series of steps required to achieve a desired outcome. For example, a "Reserve a Table" journey might involve asking questions, checking availability via API calls, and confirming the reservation.

By default, you will start with a **Default Journey**, which includes a basic welcome message. From here, you can add another journey by clicking the **+** button.

- **Journey Title**: Provide a descriptive title that captures the essence of the journey (e.g., "Reservation Process").
- **AI Description**: This is crucial for BotCircuits AI engine to understand and invoke the correct journey based on user queries. Be specific and clear about the journey's purpose.

---

## Step 4: Customize the Journey Steps

In the **Canvas Editor**, you can drag and drop components to build out the steps of your journey. This visual editor makes it easy to map out the flow of your assistant's interactions.

- **Components**: Add interactions like API calls, question prompts, card components and more.
- For detailed information on each component, refer to [Component Documentation](/journey-components).

---

## Step 5: Customizing the AI agent's Behavior

To further refine how your agent behaves, you can provide system-level prompt. Navigate to **Content > Instructions** to add a **System Prompt**. This prompt will guide the assistant's behavior throughout conversations.

> **Tip:** You can also create AI agents driven purely by system prompt, offering more control over their responses.

---

## Step 6: Integrate Knowledge Bases

Enhance your agent's capabilities by integrating knowledge bases. Go to **Content > Knowledge Base** and upload documents such as PDFs, CSVs, or DOCX files. This allows your assistant to reference specific information from these documents during conversations.

- **Supported Formats**: PDF, CSV, DOCX
- **Use Case Example**: Upload product manuals or FAQ documents to provide contextual answers to customer queries.

---

## Step 7: Customize Web Chat Appearance and Preview

Now it's time to customize your assistant's appearance and preview it in action. Click on **Channels** in the side navigation bar, then select **Web Chat**. Here, you can adjust the appearance of your chat widget to match your branding.

- **Preview**: View how your assistant will appear on your website and interact with users.

---

## Step 8: Publish Your Changes

Once you’ve completed building and configuring your AI assistant, it’s time to publish your changes. In the top-right corner of the platform, you'll see the **Publish** button. Clicking this will deploy your updates to the production environment, making them live for your users.

- **Tip:** Ensure you thoroughly test your assistant before publishing to avoid any issues in the live environment.

---

## Step 9: Embed the Chat Widget on Your Website

After publishing, it's time to integrate the assistant into your website. Navigate to the **Web Chat** page, where you’ll find the code snippet needed to embed the chat widget.

- **Instructions**: Copy and paste the provided code snippet into your web application’s HTML. This will enable the BotCircuits chat widget on your site, allowing users to interact with your AI assistant.
- **Further Customization**: For detailed information on publishing to other channels or customizing the chat experience, refer to our [Channels Documentation](/channels).
