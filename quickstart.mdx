## 9 simple steps to build your first AI agent

<Step stepNumber="1">

<Accordion title="Creating a New Agent">
After signing in to the BotCircuits platform, you'll land on the [Home Page](https://platform.botcircuits.com/agents). To begin, click the **New Assistant** button.
</Accordion>
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="2">

<Accordion title="Naming and Describing Your Agent">
You'll be prompted to provide a **Name** and **Description** for your new agent. This is for your internal use only, helping you identify the agent within your dashboard.

- **Name**: Choose a name that reflects the agent's purpose (e.g., "AI Support" or "AI Reservation Agent").
- **Description**: Add a brief description to remind yourself of the agent's function.

This information is not used by the AI and is purely for organizational purposes.
</Accordion>
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="3">

<Accordion title="Designing the User Journey">

Once you've created your agent, you'll be redirected to the **Journey Editor**. The journey represents the series of steps required to achieve a desired outcome. For example, a "Reserve a Table" journey might involve asking questions, checking availability via API calls, and confirming the reservation.

By default, you will start with a **Default Journey**, which includes a basic welcome message. From here, you can add another journey by clicking the **+** button.

- **Journey Title**: Provide a descriptive title that captures the essence of the journey (e.g., "Reservation Process").
- **AI Description**: Add a description that explains both the purpose of the journey and when it should be triggered, providing clarity to the AI model about the journey's function.
</Accordion>
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="4">

<Accordion title="Customizing the Journey Steps">
In the **Canvas Editor**, you can drag and drop components to build out the steps of your journey. This visual editor makes it easy to map out the flow of your agent's interactions.

- **Components**: Add interactions like API calls, question prompts, card components, and more.
- For detailed information on each component, refer to [Component Documentation](/journey-components).
</Accordion>
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="5">

<Accordion title="Customizing the AI Agent's Behavior">
To further refine how your agent behaves, you can provide a system-level prompt. Navigate to **Content > Instructions** to add a **System Prompt**. This prompt will guide the agent's behavior throughout conversations.

> **Tip:** You can also create AI agents driven purely by system prompts, offering more control over their responses.
</Accordion>
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="6">
<Accordion title="Integrating Knowledge Bases">

Enhance your agent's capabilities by integrating knowledge bases. Go to **Content > Knowledge Base** and upload documents such as PDFs, CSVs, or DOCX files. This allows your agent to reference specific information from these documents during conversations.

- **Supported Formats**: PDF, CSV, DOCX
- **Use Case Example**: Upload product manuals or FAQ documents to provide contextual answers to customer queries.
</Accordion>
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="7">

<Accordion title="Customizing Web Chat Appearance">
Now it's time to customize your agent's appearance and preview it in action. Click on **Channels** in the side navigation bar, then select **Web Chat**. Here, you can adjust the appearance of your chat widget to match your branding.

- **Preview**: View how your agent will appear on your website and interact with users.
</Accordion>
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="8">
<Accordion title="Publishing Your Changes">
Once you’ve completed building and configuring your AI agent, it’s time to publish your changes. In the top-right corner of the platform, you'll see the **Publish** button. Clicking this will deploy your updates to the production environment, making them live for your users.

- **Tip:** Ensure you thoroughly test your agent before publishing to avoid any issues in the live environment.
</Accordion>
</Step>

<Step stepNumber="9">

<Accordion title="Embedding the Chat Widget">
After publishing, it's time to integrate the agent into your website. Navigate to the **Web Chat** page, where you’ll find the code snippet needed to embed the chat widget.

- **Instructions**: Copy and paste the provided code snippet into your web application’s HTML. This will enable the BotCircuits chat widget on your site, allowing users to interact with your AI agent.
- **Further Customization**: For detailed information on publishing to other channels or customizing the chat experience, refer to our [Channels Documentation](/channels).
</Accordion>
</Step>
